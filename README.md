# Project Background
Kaohom Jewelry is a mock business dataset I created for a learning project, simulating operations from January 2022 to December 2024. The business specializes in jewelry accessories, including silver, pearl, gold, and diamond pieces. The dataset is designed to reflect real-world complexity, covering multiple levels of analysis: transactional, customer, marketing performance, manpower, funnel performance, business efficiency and business outcomes.

# Project/Business Workflow
While working on this project, I imagined the end-to-end business workflow as if I were responsible for driving outcomes in a real role. This led me to design a flowchart that outlines the strategic process, from insight generation to team action, KPI tracking, and a feedback loop. Although this is a mock business and the feedback loop isnâ€™t implemented, the structure reflects how a real-world system could function effectively.

# Brief Summary 
This analysis is based on 35,000 sales records from 2022 to 2024, with total revenue consistently reaching approximately $10 million. 76% of sales were generated through physical branches, while 24% came from the online website. The average Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) across all channels is approximately $1,100, with a mean Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) ratio of 63. These figures indicate that the business is both healthy and profitable. Strong customer retention plays a key role, with 72% of customers being repeat buyers and only 28% making a one-time purchase. This high retention rate suggests effective customer engagement and long-term value creation.
