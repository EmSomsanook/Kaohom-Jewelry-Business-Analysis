## Project Background
Kaohom Jewelry is a mock business dataset I created for a learning project, simulating operations from January 2022 to December 2024. The business specializes in jewelry accessories, including silver, pearl, gold, and diamond pieces. The dataset is designed to reflect real-world complexity, covering multiple levels of analysis: transactional, customer, marketing performance, manpower, funnel performance, business efficiency and business outcomes.

## Project/Business Workflow
While working on this project, I imagined the end-to-end business workflow as if I were responsible for driving outcomes in a real role. This led me to design a flowchart that outlines the strategic process, from insight generation to team action, KPI tracking, and a feedback loop. Although this is a mock business and the feedback loop isn’t implemented, the structure reflects how a real-world system could function effectively.

## Insight Summary
This analysis is based on 35,000 sales records from 2022 to 2024, with total revenue consistently reaching approximately $10 million. 76% of sales were generated through physical branches, while 24% came from the online website. The average Customer Lifetime Value(CLV) across all channels is approximately $550, with a mean Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) ratio of 15. These figures indicate that the business is both healthy and profitable. Strong customer retention plays a key role, with 72% of customers being repeat buyers and only 28% making a one-time purchase. This high retention rate suggests effective customer engagement and long-term value creation.

### Sales Trend and Growth Rate
- Revenue held steady at around $10 million per month, with a sharp 300% spike in December 2024. Monthly orders averaged about 1,000, also seeing a similar spike. The sudden jump was mainly due to my data mock-up not being as realistic as it should’ve been. It's a good reminder of how important accurate test data is for reliable analysis.
- We saw a 42% growth in March 2022, driven by the sale of 8 natural diamond anklets and 7 natural diamond necklaces. Another 22% growth came in December 2022, following strong performance from the MichaelAcademy campaign in November. The CLV/CAC ratio reached an impressive 81.90, thanks to a relatively low customer acquisition cost of $8.94 and strong customer lifetime value.
