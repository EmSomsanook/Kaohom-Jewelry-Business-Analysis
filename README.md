## Project Background
Kaohom Jewelry is a mock business dataset I created for a learning project, simulating operations from January 2022 to December 2024. The business specializes in jewelry accessories, including silver, pearl, gold, and diamond pieces. The dataset is designed to reflect real-world complexity, covering multiple levels of analysis: transactional, customer, marketing performance, manpower, funnel performance, business efficiency and business outcomes.

## Project/Business Workflow
While working on this project, I imagined the end-to-end business workflow as if I were responsible for driving outcomes in a real role. This led me to design a flowchart that outlines the strategic process, from insight generation to team action, KPI tracking, and a feedback loop. Although this is a mock business and the feedback loop isnâ€™t implemented, the structure reflects how a real-world system could function effectively.

Project Workflow: Blurred on purpose. No secrets, just donâ€™t want to spoil the funðŸ˜‰.


PS. I'm not planning to do RFM or any customer segmentation at this stage, as this is just a learning project and I prefer to avoid that level of complexity for now.

## Insight Summary
This analysis is based on 35,000 sales records from 2022 to 2024, with total revenue consistently reaching approximately $10 million. 76% of sales were generated through physical branches, while 24% came from the online website. The average Customer Lifetime Value(CLV) across all channels is approximately $600, with a mean Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) ratio of 15. These figures indicate that the business is both healthy and profitable. Strong customer retention plays a key role, with 72% of all-time customers being repeat buyers and only 28% making a one-time purchase. This high retention rate suggests effective customer engagement and long-term value creation.

## Insights Deep-Dive and Specific Recommendations
### Demographic Insights (Customer Understanding and Branch Contribution and Comparative Metrics)
- Monthly customer volume stable at around 900. Customer retention is a major strength, with 72% of customers making repeat purchases and only 28% being one-time buyers.

- Repeat buyer rates remain stable at 50â€“55% month-on-month, despite strong long-term retention (72% of all-time customers). This indicates that monthly revenue growth still relies heavily on acquiring new customers. At the same time, the upward trend in repeat buyer share suggests our CRM is performing well. To move beyond assumption, we should A/B test CRM impact by comparing retention between customers with and without CRM exposure. If the data shows causation, not just correlation, weâ€™ll have clear justification to scale CRM investment. Otherwise, resources can be reallocated to higher-yield acquisition channels.

- Customer data shows that 60% of our buyers are Lao citizens, with 20% from Thailand and 20% from other nationalities. Gender distribution is nearly balanced at 50/50. This insight shows strong local support, showing a point of pride and proof of product-market fit in our home country. At the same time, with 40% of customers being non-Lao, we see clear potential for international growth. This diversity signals that our product quality and pricing are competitive beyond local borders. The balanced gender ratio also suggests we should maintain inclusive marketing strategies, avoiding assumptions that jewelry appeals primarily to women. This helps us avoid gender bias and better serve a wider audience.

- Our business shows solid profitability, with an average customer lifetime value (CLV) of $600. The 36â€“45 age group not only represents the largest customer segment but also delivers the highest CLV. This makes them a clear priority for both marketing and retention strategies. By the way, the gap between age segments isnâ€™t significantly wide based on the current (mocked) data. For now, an all-age marketing approach remains practical. However, in a real business context, further A/B testing and segmentation analysis would be essential to validate whether focused targeting drives materially better ROI.

- Customer share by branch shows the highest contribution from the online website at 23.5%, followed by the Luang Prabang shop at 21.7% and the Vientiane shop at 20.3%, with CLV performance showing minimal variance across all branches. However, total sales are still dominated by physical branches at 76.5%, with online contributing 23.5%. This indicates clear potential to grow the online channel further while also strengthening CRM efforts for offline customers.

### Spending Trends and Expense Metrics
- Our manpower-related fixed cost stands at $31,700, with 36% allocated to customer acquisition and 64% directed toward retention and other operational processes. This cost structure reflects a heavier focus on sustaining operations and serving existing customers.

- Monthly marketing spend averages $8,400, with Facebook Ads being the primary channel. While the highest overall expense remains Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), it's excluded from metric-based analysis, as it consistently yields a 50% profit margin by design.

### Acquisition Channel Efficiency
- Analysis of first-touch data shows that walk-in traffic is the top acquisition channel. This is partly due to attribution gaps that many customers see online ads but head straight to the physical store without triggering UTM tracking. This highlights the critical role of offline presence in building trust, especially in a high-value category like jewelry. As we scale online, offline cannot be neglected. This also reinforces the logic behind our current cost structure, which prioritizes support for physical channels.

- If we exclude offline channels, which are hard to track. Influencer marketing delivers the highest acquisition performance, with 8% more new customers compared to Facebook Ads, while costing only half as much. However, it comes with an 8% lower CLV as a trade-off. Even so, this clearly suggests we should invest more in influencer marketing and reduce spending on Facebook Ads to improve efficiency.

<p align="center">

- The average cost per acquisition (CAC) across all marketing spend is approximately $18 per new customer.

- June and November 2022 stand out, with CAC dropping below $10, making them valuable case studies for future campaign planning. However, when we include manpower costs dedicated to acquisition, we get a more accurate picture of true CAC. Rises to an average of $44. This small adjustment gives us a clearer understanding of the real cost behind each new customer.

- Finally, the return on ad spend (ROAS) demonstrates strong performance, with an average ratio of 15 when comparing customer value to acquisition cost. This indicates a high level of marketing efficiency. Given this return, reallocating more budget toward high-performing channels like influencer marketing presents a strategic opportunity to further improve results. The next section outlines key influencer insights to guide reinvestment decisions.

### Influencer ROI & Efficiency
- Based on the top ten influencer channels sorted by ratio, MichaelAcademy stands out by securing all top three positions, consistently delivering the lowest CAC and high CLV. This makes him a clear priority for reinvestment. For a well-balanced budget allocation, other strong-performing options include MichelleUniverse, CarmenSport, and KristinTravel. These channels offer a solid mix of cost efficiency and customer value, making them strategic choices for scaling.

- MichelleUniverse has the highest CAC among the three, but also delivers the highest CLV. This suggests potential for a customer base retention strategy to maximize long-term value.

- CarmenSport shows the lowest CAC along with a lower CLV. However, securing two spots in the top ten indicates strong potential. Reinvestment is recommended, alongside introducing loyalty programs or bundled offers to lift CLV.

- KristinTravel follows a clear scaling strategy, evidenced by the highest customer volume and total sales, with acceptable CAC and CLV. Reinvestment is advisable, though tracking the ratio of one-time to repeat customers is important to monitor churn risk that often comes with rapid growth.

### Key Product Performance
- 50% of our revenue is generated by the top five performing products, four of which are made from gold. This reflects strong demand for gold products, indicating gold collections should remain a strategic focus in both product development and marketing efforts.

- The second standout material in the top 10 products is diamond (both, lab-grown and natural), accounting for only 2.9% of total sales but contributing 20% of revenue. This is a clear example of the Pareto effect, where a small segment drives a disproportionate share of value. To maximize this high-spending segment, we recommend implementing targeted retention strategies. Approaches could include exclusive offers, early access to new diamond collections, loyalty rewards, and personalized CRM touchpoints to reinforce brand value and increase lifetime spend.

- Silver accounts for the highest customer volume, representing 45.7% of total buyers but contributing only 6.6% of total revenue. This clearly positions silver as an entry-level product, effective for scaling the customer base. To maximize value from this segment, we recommend focused upselling strategies, such as introducing limited-edition upgrades or bundling silver with higher-margin items. Implementing a tiered loyalty program can also incentivize repeat purchases and encourage progression toward premium product lines, this helps increasing customer lifetime value.

### Sales Trend and Growth Rate
- Revenue held steady at around $1 million per month, with a sharp 300% spike in December 2024. Monthly orders averaged about 1,000, also seeing a similar spike. The sudden jump was mainly due to my data mock-up not being as realistic as it shouldâ€™ve been. It's a good reminder of how important accurate test data is for reliable analysis.

- March 2022 recorded a 42% growth rate, driven by a 15% reduction in marketing spend and a 33.8% increase in customer numbers. Also in December 2022 reached 22%, mainly driven by returning customers.

### Net Earnings
- Over the past three years, net profit has demonstrated consistent growth, rising from $5.1 million in 2022 to $6.2 million in 2023, and reaching $7.2 million in 2024.

- Driven in part by our consistent 50% gross margin. On paper, this margin paints a clear path to profitability and implies ease in modeling unit economics. However, itâ€™s important to recognize that real-world execution is far more complex.

### Email Funnel Performance: Conversion Analysis
- Our monthly email funnel marketing yields an average conversion rate of 0.32%, translating to approximately 3â€“4 purchases per 1,000 recipients. While this channel is cost-effective and primarily aimed at retention, its low performance highlights the need for refinement.

- While a 0.32% email conversion rate aligns with industry benchmarks in the jewelry sector, I'm concerned about the long-term impact of high-frequency email campaigns. There's a strategic risk that we may push away our customer base with annoying behavior, leading to churn and weakened brand credibility.

- The conversion rate spiked above average in July 2022 and December 2024, reaching 0.7% and 0.6% respectively. These periods stand out as potential case studies, showing that with the right message and timing, email can still drive meaningful results. Itâ€™s worth revisiting what worked then and replicating those strategies.

## Some reflections
Some parts of the mock data used in this project may not fully reflect real-world complexity, but they were sufficient for demonstrating the key concepts and analysis in this showcase.

There are also components I could have included, such as customer segmentation or even machine learning predictions. But I decided to keep the scope focused, as those areas can become quite complex.

That said, I havenâ€™t yet had the opportunity to work on a real stakeholder-driven project. Iâ€™m aware that there's still much for me to learn and improve when it comes to applying data in business-critical contexts.
