## Project Background
Kaohom Jewelry is a mock business dataset I created for a learning project, simulating operations from January 2022 to December 2024. The business specializes in jewelry accessories, including silver, pearl, gold, and diamond pieces. The dataset is designed to reflect real-world complexity, covering multiple levels of analysis: transactional, customer, marketing performance, manpower, funnel performance, business efficiency and business outcomes.

## Project/Business Workflow
While working on this project, I imagined the end-to-end business workflow as if I were responsible for driving outcomes in a real role. This led me to design a flowchart that outlines the strategic process, from insight generation to team action, KPI tracking, and a feedback loop. Although this is a mock business and the feedback loop isn’t implemented, the structure reflects how a real-world system could function effectively.

## Insight Summary
This analysis is based on 35,000 sales records from 2022 to 2024, with total revenue consistently reaching approximately $10 million. 76% of sales were generated through physical branches, while 24% came from the online website. The average Customer Lifetime Value(CLV) across all channels is approximately $550, with a mean Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) ratio of 15. These figures indicate that the business is both healthy and profitable. Strong customer retention plays a key role, with 72% of customers being repeat buyers and only 28% making a one-time purchase. This high retention rate suggests effective customer engagement and long-term value creation.

## Insights Deep-Dive
### Demographic Insights (Customer Understanding and Branch Contribution and Comparative Metrics)
- Customer share by branch shows the highest contribution from the online website at 23.5%, followed by the Luang Prabang shop at 21.7% and the Vientiane shop at 20.3%. However, total sales are still dominated by physical branches at 76.5%, with online contributing 23.5%. This indicates clear potential to grow the online channel further while also strengthening CRM efforts for offline customers.
- Customer data shows that 60% of our buyers are Lao citizens, with 20% from Thailand and 20% from other nationalities. Gender distribution is nearly balanced at 50/50. This insight shows strong local support, showing a point of pride and proof of product-market fit in our home country. At the same time, with 40% of customers being non-Lao, we see clear potential for international growth. This diversity signals that our product quality and pricing are competitive beyond local borders. The balanced gender ratio also suggests we should maintain inclusive marketing strategies, avoiding assumptions that jewelry appeals primarily to women. This helps us avoid gender bias and better serve a wider audience.

### Sales Trend and Growth Rate
- Revenue held steady at around $10 million per month, with a sharp 300% spike in December 2024. Monthly orders averaged about 1,000, also seeing a similar spike. The sudden jump was mainly due to my data mock-up not being as realistic as it should’ve been. It's a good reminder of how important accurate test data is for reliable analysis.
- March 2022 recorded a 42% growth rate, driven by a 15% reduction in marketing spend and a 33.8% increase in customer numbers. December 2022 saw 22% growth, influenced by the performance of the MichaelAcademy campaign in November. The campaign achieved a CLV/CAC ratio of 81.90, supported by a low CAC of $8.94 and strong customer value. These insights can be applied to improve the effectiveness of future campaigns.
